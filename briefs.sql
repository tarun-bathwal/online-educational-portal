(1, 'Cundy V Lindsay, (1878) 3 App Cas 458 HL', '<h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n<p>The foundation of contract law is premised on mutual agreement, i.e., agreeing on the same thing in the same sense, popularly referred to as consensus ad idem.<sup>1</sup> As a general rule, where such an agreement is prima facie found, contract is mostly sought to be enforced for the sake of commercial convenience and brevity.<sup>2</sup> However, such enforcement is not devoid of exceptions, for instance - in situations where it is found that the mutual consent is negative or nullified due to, inter alia, fraud, coercion, undue influence, misrepresentation and/or mistake.<sup>3</sup></p>\r\n<p>Mistake principally negatives consent in a contract, as explained by Lord Atkin- "If mistake operates at all, it operates so as to negative or in some cases to nullify consent".<sup>4</sup> Having said that, such mistake must be fundamental to the contract, and the scope of which has been interpreted by courts in a much restrictive sense.<sup>5</sup> The origin of law in this context may be traced back to the early case of Cundy v Lindsay,<sup>6</sup> discussed in detail below.</p>\r\n<div class="panel disclaimer-box hidden-print">\r\n<div class="panel-heading text-center">\r\n<h3>&nbsp;Facts</h3>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The claimant received an order for sale of handkerchiefs from a person named Blenkarn, who signed in his name in a manner resembling "Blenkiron &amp; Co."- a reputed firm located at "123, Wood Street". The purchaser further mentioned his address to be at "37, Wood Street, Cheapside", to which the claimant sent the goods. Although no payment was made by Blenkarn, he sold the goods to a third person- the defendants.</p>\r\n<p>Later, the claimants alleged that, as they sold the goods to Blenkarn under the mistaken assumption that they were selling it to Blenkiron &amp; Co., there was no real consent to the contract of sale. Consequently, there was no valid transfer of title, which remained with the claimants, and accordingly, they sued the defendants for conversion of goods.</p>\r\n<h2>Issues</h2>\r\n<p>The case concerned whether a mistake as to the identity of a contracting party was so fundamental so as to negate the consent of the other party, and thereby, causing the contract to be void. In other words, the question was whether there was any contract between the claimant and Blenkarn at the first place, and if not, could the third party defendants procure a valid title to the goods.</p>\r\n<h2>Ruling</h2>\r\n<p>It was held that, as the claimant did not intend to sell the handkerchiefs to Blenkarn but to Blenkiron &amp; Co., there was no consent of the claimant to the contract with the former. Accordingly, as no contract was concluded between the claimant and Blenkarn so as to constitute a valid transfer of title which the latter could rightfully convey to the defendants, the title remained with the claimant. Hence, the defendants, being in possession without a good title over such goods, were held liable for conversion.</p>\r\n<p>This rationale found support in later cases of Ingram v Little,<sup>7</sup> and Hector v Lyons.<sup>8</sup> In the former case, it was held that although the sale was undertaken face-to-face, as the seller agreed to receive payment by cheque from only "Mr. Hutchinson" situated at a specified address, and not from the actual purchaser who wrongfully transacted on his name, the contract was void. Likewise, in the latter case, the court did not allow a father to enforce a contract against the vendor in which his son was named as the contracting party.</p>\r\n<h2>Implications</h2>\r\n<p>The above ruling, in effect, meant that an honest and bonafide third party purchaser could be prejudiced due to the dishonest dealings of one contracting party in the original nullified contract. In other words, following Cundy v Lindsay and Ingram v Little, a seller can nullify a contract as void and retain title of goods sold if the sale happens under a mistaken identity of the purchaser, notwithstanding that such goods may have been transmitted by such purchaser to a bonafide third party for value in the interim.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the serious repercussions on honest third party dealers, the above principle of Cundy v Lindsay has been subject to much criticism, and has subsequently been "confined within very narrow limits".<sup>9</sup> For instance, the ruling was contrasted in King''s Norton Metal Co. Ltd v Edridge, Merrett &amp; Co. Ltd.,<sup>10</sup> where the court distinguished between mistake of identity and mistake of attributes, stating that while the former rendered a contract void, the latter did not. Similar views were upheld in Lewis v Averay,<sup>11</sup> where the claimant had sold the car to one falsely claiming to be a renowned actor. Ruling that there was no mistake of identity (but of the attribute of credit worthiness), the contract was held to be not so void. However, such distinction is not always definite and ascertainable, as highlighted in Lake v Simmons.<sup>12</sup></p>\r\n<p>Another exception made was in respect of mode of the contract, i.e., whether executed face-to-face or in writing.<sup>13</sup> There lies a presumption in the event of face-to-face dealings that the seller intended to contract with the person physically before him identified by sight and person, and accordingly, there can be no mistake of identity so as to render the contract void.<sup>14</sup> On the contrary, in a written contract, the identity of the parties is ascertained as per the express terms of the contract,<sup>15</sup> as also advanced in Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n<p>Finally, the scope of "mistake as to identity" has been further curtailed to only such mistakes which are operative and induce the contract.<sup>17</sup> For instance, in Mackie v European Assurance Soc,<sup>18</sup> an insurance policy executed with an insurer company believing it to be another was held not void, as the claimant intend to get insurance so long as the insurer company would meet its requirements.</p>\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n<p>It is clear from the above that the traditional principle of mistake of identity rendering a contract void, as laid down by Cundy v Lindsay, stands much eroded to give way to several exceptions, more particularly, where the interests of a bonafide third party is involved. This is further acknowledged by the exceptions to the doctrine of nemo dat quad non habet under the Sale of Goods Act, 1979, which bestows a valid title to an honest third party purchaser regardless of any specified irregularities in the original sale.<sup>19</sup> All in all, Cundy v Lindsay, although not formally overruled, has been much diluted and holds little relevance today.<sup>20</sup> The overall position on "mistake as to identity" in contract law remains ambiguous and continues to be a vexed issue.</p>\r\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\r\n<p><sup>1</sup>Smith v Hughes, (1871) LR 6 QB 597.</p>\r\n<p><sup>2</sup>G.

(2, 'Dennant V Skinner And Collom [1948] 2 KB 164 (KBD)', '<h2>Background</h2>\r\n<p>Dennant v Skinner and Collom<sup>1</sup> is but one in a long line of cases concerning whether a unilateral mistake in inter praesentes or face-to-face dealings would void the contract formed. These commonly involve the claimant selling his goods to a rogue who assumes the identity of another and who later sells the goods on to an unsuspecting third party. The rogue then disappears, leaving the claimant and the third party (usually the defendant) to litigate over whether the initial contract was void ab initio. If the contract was valid, then the defendant would be deemed the rightful owner of the goods; if not, then the goods would have to be returned to the claimant.</p>\r\n<p>After the decision of the House of Lords in Lake v Simmons,<sup>2</sup> which cited the earlier case of Phillips v Brooks,<sup>3</sup> the general position is a presumption that the claimant intended to deal with the person physically present in front of him at the time of the contract, instead of the person the rogue purported to be. However, the presumption can be rebutted by showing that the identity was a crucial consideration of the claimant, and the importance was such that the claimant would not have entered into the contract had he known that the identity presented by the rogue was fictitious.</p>\r\n<h2>Issues In The Case</h2>\r\n<p>In Dennant, the main dispute was over the importance placed by the claimant on the rogue''s identity at the time of the contract, a matter which the court chose to resolve by determining whether the claimant would have entered into the contract had he known the rogue''s true identity. A slightly lesser issue was whether property in the goods had passed from the claimant, given the lack of actual payment by the rogue.</p>\r\n<h2>Facts</h2>\r\n<p>In an auction held by the claimant (Dennant), a man successfully bid for a van. After the lot was knocked down to him, he identified himself as George Albert King from King''s Motors of Oxford, a highly reputable firm in the industry. Five more vehicles were subsequently knocked down to King by the claimant, including the vehicle to which the proceedings related. Before allowing delivery, the claimant accepted a cheque from King, but obtained a signed certificate which stated that ownership of the vehicles would not pass until the cheque was honoured.</p>\r\n<p>The cheque was dishonoured, and the claimant subsequently discovered that King had no actual connection with King''s Motors. Some time later, the relevant vehicle came to be in the possession of the defendant (Skinner), who refused to return the vehicle. The claimant brought proceedings for the return of the vehicle, and the defendant brought in Collom, the person from whom he bought the vehicle as a third party. The claim was dismissed by Hallett J in the King''s Bench Division.</p>\r\n<h2>Decision</h2>\r\n<p>After applying Lake v Simmons, Hallett J held that the claimant''s mistake as to King''s identity did not affect the validity of the contract, which was concluded on the fall of the hammer. At that point in time, no inquiry was made about King''s identity. In fact, the identity of the highest bidder was never considered by the claimant at the time, and Hallett J found that the claimant would have been willing to transact with any other person irrespective of their identity. The certificate similarly had no effect on the contract, as the contract was concluded before the execution of the certificate.</p>\r\n<p>The second issue was also decided in favour of the defendant, as Hallett J found that property in the vehicle had passed from the claimant to King when the lot was knocked down to him. Pursuant to Rule 1, s.18 of SOGA 1893, the parties were deemed to have intended the property to pass when the contract was made, irrespective of any delay in payment or delivery. Such intention was negatived neither by conditions of the auction nor the certificate, which only allowed the claimant to retain possession &ndash; but not ownership &ndash; of the vehicle until the cheque was honoured.</p>\r\n<h2>Commentary</h2>\r\n<p>Dennant has mainly been recognised as an example in a series of cases notable for establishing the general position in inter praesentes cases as mentioned above, alongside Lake v Simmons and Phillips v Brooks. It was cited in Ingram v Little<sup>4</sup> and more recently by the House of Lords in Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson.<sup>5</sup></p>\r\n<p>A related question which Dennant does not explicitly deal with is whether contracts tainted by mistakes as to identity are void or voidable. As the former treats contracts as if they never existed at law, no title passes from the claimant to the rogue nor from the rogue to the third party. The latter, on the other hand, allows the contract to exist as a valid agreement until set aside, thereby making it possible for title to pass to the third party. As MacMillan notes,<sup>6</sup> authorities on this point seem to be divided into three categories: where mistakes as to identity do not affect the validity of the contract,<sup>7</sup> where a contract is void for mistake as to identity,<sup>8</sup> and where the contract is voidable for fraud.<sup>9</sup> Dennant appears to fall firmly within the first category, and Hallett J specifically left unanswered the question of whether the second or the third would be more desirable.<sup>10</sup></p>\r\n<p>In its discussion of when property passes, Dennant was concerned with the older incarnation of Rule 1, s.18 in the Sale of Goods Act 1893, and not its counterpart in the Sale of Goods Act 1979. However, Dennant is still treated as good authority for the purposes of the new Rule 1, s.18 as both provisions are identically worded.<sup>11</sup></p>\r\n<h2>Footnotes</h2>\r\n<p><sup>1</sup><a href="https://www.lawteacher.net/cases/commercial-law/luxor-v-cooper.php">Luxor (Eastbourne) v Cooper</a> [1941] A.C. 108</p>\r\n<p><sup>2</sup>N Ryder, M Griffiths and L Singh, Commercial Law (Cambridge University Press 2012) 44.</p>\r\n<p><sup>3</sup>A S Burrows, ''Free acceptance and the law of restitution'' (1988) 104 Law Quarterly Review 576, 576.</p>\r\n<p><sup>4</sup>Way v Latilla [1937] 3 All ER 759</p>\r\n<p><sup>5</sup>A Lodder, ''Benedetti v Sawiris: unjust enrichment and the assessment of quantum meruit awards'' (2010)126 Law Quarterly Review 42, 45.</p>\r\n<p><sup>6</sup>M F Levine and JH Williams, ''Restitutionary Quantum Meruit - The Crossroads'' (1992) 8(3) Construction Law Journal 244, 244.</p>\r\n<p><sup>7</sup>Ibid.</p>\r\n<p><sup>8</sup>Luxor (Eastbourne) v Cooper [1941] A.C. 108, per Lord Romer at 155.</p>\r\n<p><sup>9</sup>Alpha Trading Ltd. v Dunnshaw-Patten Ltd [1981] Q.B. 290</p>\r\n<p><sup>10</sup>French and Co Ltd v Leeston Shipping Co Ltd [1922] 1 A.C. 451</p>\r\n<p><sup>11</sup>Alpha Trading Ltd. v Dunnshaw-Patten Ltd [1981] Q.B. 290, per Brandon L J at 294.</p>\r\n<p><sup>12</sup>Alpha Trading Ltd. v Dunnshaw-Patten Ltd [1981] Q.B. 290.</p>\r\n<p><sup>13</sup>M F Levine and JH Williams, ''Restitutionary Quantum Meruit - The Crossroads'' (1992) 8(3) Construction Law Journal 244, 244.</p>');
